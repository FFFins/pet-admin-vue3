The pet industry has seen significant transformation over the last few decades, with pets increasingly regarded as essential family members. In many countries, particularly the U.S., pet ownership is widespread, with nearly {60\%} of households owning one or more pets, including dogs, cats, and other domestic animals\cite{1}. Pet owners are increasingly willing to invest heavily in the care and well-being of their pets, spending billions annually on products and services. However, with increasingly busy lifestyles, many pet owners find it difficult to consistently care for their pets. This is particularly true in counties with a high percentage of immigrants or expatriates, where individuals may be juggling demanding jobs, or adjusting to a new environment. These factors often leave them with less time to provide the proper care and attention their pets require.
